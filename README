Quick start
===========

- You first need to download and process the database. Check for instructions in:
  http://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/scenesemantics/database.zip

- Change Matlab's current directory into the directory of this README.
  
- Launch computation with
>> ssem_main('path/where/you/created/the/database', 'demo');

- Results for each split will be stored in: 
  path/where/you/created/the/database/results/demo/perf.txt

- Check out the project page for additional code and data:
